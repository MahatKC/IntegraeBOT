# IntegraeBOT

Discord BOT developed by [Igor Fran√ßa Negrizoli](https://github.com/igorFNegrizoli) and [Mateus Karvat Camara](https://github.com/MahatKC) in 2021.

It was used during an online event to separate participants on-the-fly in different conversation groups. Participants merely sent the BOT their university and were assigned with 2 other people to conduct an activity. The BOT queued participants from the same university and tried, as best as possible, to create groups with people from different universities.
